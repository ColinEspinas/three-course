# Three Course Experimentation

This project is an exercise on the theme of threejs.
The goal of the exercise is to create a 3d scene to learn the basics of threejs.

For this exercise, we made a blob using vertex and fragment shaders.
You can play with it and create presets by tweaking the settings and clicking the "Create preset" button.

> If you have loaded the page during the presetation, we recommend to clear you local storage to get the best experience.

## Structure

This repository is a standard vite project using the typescript vanilla preset.
